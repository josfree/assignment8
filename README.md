# assignment8
I made the mistake of assuming this project was due today and I did not realize it was due two days ago until tomorrow. 
I was planning on going to the tutor for help and possibly taking a late grade
Since today is the last day for late work, I have to submit this program.
I have a few funtions commented out because I do not have time to correct them.
I am not sure why my Makefile is not working properly.
Once I uploaded the files into git hub, I did not know how to open the files inside of putty to make more changes.
